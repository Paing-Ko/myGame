# (NHS) Virus Hunt Game üè•üî¨

## Introduction

Welcome to the NHS Virus Hunt Game! This game was built as a part of my application for Founders and Coders (FAC) to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, and also as a part of my portfolio website.

The game is an intriguing and educational adventure where you play as an NHS staff member equipped with coding skills and medical knowledge. You will deploy your knowledge to create defense mechanisms within a human body invaded by viruses.

## Game Overview

In this game, your mission is to protect a human body from an onslaught of viruses by solving coding and health-related challenges. Armed with your coding skills and medical knowledge, you are humanity's last hope. 

### Gameplay

* The game is set in a human body that has been invaded by viruses.
* You will need to create defenses within the body to hunt and eradicate viruses.
* You will be given two types of questions (coding and health), each having 4 options to choose from.
* Choose the correct code or answer to deploy your defenses.

### Storyline

As you were working on your project, you discovered that viruses have invaded the human body and are causing chaos. Make use of your medical expertise, choose the correct code and deploy it to save the day!

### Rules

* Game starts with Score: 0 & Health: 100%, with no time limit.
* You will be given two types of questions (coding and health) each having 4 options to choose from.
* Coding challenges and options will be displayed in green.
* Type the number of your answer and deploy it to combat viruses.
* Your score increases for each virus eliminated.
* To keep your health above 0, answer health-related questions in red (+5 for correct answers).
* Be careful! If you answer incorrectly or virus escape and hit the wall, you lose health (by -5).
* The game ends when your health reaches zero.
